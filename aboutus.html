	<section class="AboutUs">
	<h2>We are the Sri Lanka's largest teaching platform</h2>
	<img src="Images/teaching.jpg">
	<p>Linfield University is one of the world’s leading academic and research institutions, offering a unique educational experience that prepares the next generation of global citizens to lead and make a difference in the world. We are a vibrant community of exceptional students, faculty, alumni and professionals dedicated to real-world applications of our research, scholarship, faith and service.</p><br>

	<h2>Dorm Life: Living on Campus</h2>
	<img src="Images/hostel.jpg">
	<p>Find your home in one of our 17 undergraduate residences, including rooms, suites, townhouses and apartments. You’ll create lifelong friendships by living and learning together as you bond over Netflix nights, shared meals, homework and more.
Get ready to settle in at Linfield. Live on campus in a suite-style room, apartment or living-learning community, or apply to the Capitol Applied Learning Lab (CALL), where you’ll live in the heart of the country, intern during the day and take classes at night. Make your home in one of the most exciting cities in the world.</p><br>

<h2>Clubs and Organizations</h2>
<img src="Images/clubs.jpg">
<p>Sing, dance, create, volunteer, compete, debate or worship – there’s a club for everyone at the university. Build a new skill, lead a team or help others as you find your friends through the university’s many student clubs and organizations.
Whether you are looking to relax between classes and meetings or find a new place to study, there are plenty of spaces on the Hilltop.</p><br>

<h2>Faculty-in-Residence</h2>
<img src="Images/residence.jpg">
<p>Faculty members also gain a deeper understanding of what the college experience is like for on-campus residents, which in turn provides a new perspective on how to approach teaching and learning within, and outside, the classroom environment.</p><br>

<h2>Ensuring safe and healthy campuses</h2>
<img src="Images/safe.jpg">
<p>Linfield has developed a completely new infrastructure to ensure continuity of our teaching and research mission, and to prepare our community for a time when we can all be safely together again. Our community will play a crucial role in supporting that ongoing work—and our institution’s long-term health.</p><br>
